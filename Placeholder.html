       <p><em>Language and Problems of Knowledge</em> (Noam Chomsky on the mind-body problem)</p>

<p>Chomsky’s argument formulates:</p>

<p>If there is no definite conception of the body, then the mind-body problem is an informulable, and consequently unsolvable, inquiry. (P → Q)</p>

<p>There is no definite conception of the body. (P)</p>

<p>Therefore, the mind-body problem is an informulable, and consequently unsolvable, inquiry. (∴ Q)</p>

<p>The antecedent is from the negation and supposed invalidity of an a priori demarcation of the body’s domain. With the advent of Newtonian mechanics and its developments, the canon of the physical world is known to support various oddities as particles with no mass, vacuums, forces that act throughout empty space, and so on. New discoveries the sciences make, whatever they are, however weird, are named “physical” or “material” and gradually comprise the notion of what the physical counts as or can be defined to include. So, the physical has no set defining as to what it is or can be. The body’s existence in physics (so to speak), further distinctions and limitations of the body from the mind derived from a priori thought should not be conjectured because the “physical” could capacitize it and/or other phenomenal attributes, instead revealing a new physical property. Ergo, the body could be anything, perhaps producing mental states or perhaps not, maybe being distinct or maybe not, but since that “anything” is yet to be discovered in physics, we have no definite conception of what the body is or what it “counts” as.</p>

<p>The consequent is to suppose the inability to compute or formulate the question from a hesitant, unconfirmed, open variable: the body. The condition from P would necessitate an imprecision of the capacities, form, and real distinction of what is often thought of as the body, making the mind-body problem informulable insofar as the objects in question have no assumable or defined referent. The problems are unsolvable because nothing is to be concluded of the terms, which have hesitant, unconfirmed and ambiguous identities. We would not be able to say anything about the relation between body and mind, because no boundaries between either can be established, and therefore no formulation of the problem (arising from distinction) can be made.</p>

<p>The Chomskyan “definite conception” is looking for strictly scientific evidence when defining the physical’s limits and conception, and rejects any “a priori” demarcations of where the body, physics, begins and ends. But this borders on, or is a form of, hard scientism; in a similar way some Protestant fundamentalists believe we can’t conclude anything about molecular biology or calculus because it’s not in the Bible, his view is extremely hesitant to conclude anything beyond scientific discovery. This kind of thinking is already self-contradictory, but suppose the same standards were applied elsewhere. The likes of possibilities such as absurdism and Last Thursdayism would always end up undermining scientific discovery; reality still has not been completely mapped out by science or physics and neither have its limitations, so Chomsky would have to posit theories that would eventually lead to the disruption of his own findings, because the validity of scientific findings would then depend on the whole of reality being defined first and allowing for the confirmation of science. Until then, science’s relation to truth and reality would remain without a clear conception, seeing the whole of the limits have still not been found.</p>

<p>See the problem? Even to say some things are already proven in science would become impossible, given that they depend on other theories that later discoveries in the nature of reality through science and physics could prove wrong, in a similar way classical mechanics were shown to be incomplete and probabilistic, as opposed to deterministic, when quantum mechanics were discovered. And therefore, what he looks for in a “definite conception” for anything would turn out to be nonsensical, including to the body. He’d essentially turn to global skepticism or paradoxes. So, Chomsky, while able to pose this “definite conception”, would have to do a fair amount of bullet biting, and possibly cancel out his premise from the antecedent’s reasoning.</p>

<p>Now, a concession is that there has not been an absolute canon of the “physical” or “material”. Indeed, since the advent of Newtonian mechanics, we have found many oddities in physics that we considered strange or impossible until science found them. Every time that happens, the “physical” gets updated in our conception of what it can be.</p>

<p>However, there are some things that we would simply refuse to consider possible for physics to begin with, and which we would do so on the grounds of intuition. This simply (and reliably, to a practical extent) works.</p>

<p><em>(To the live audience)</em> Suppose you find yourself at a new farm. The shed is the only thing built on the property and nothing else. No fencing, no maps of the land. Just one big, open rural area with nothing but grass in sight. Your task is to predict where the farmer's property begins and ends. A reasonable person could say that, while the exact borders are obscure, 50 miles to the right of the shed is likely not the farmer's property. 50 feet away to the right of the shed very likely is the property. But it would be absurd to claim that the areas 50 miles away from the shed and 50 feet away from the shed should both be given the same consideration to being the property, even if you don't have the exact legal contracts to figure it out.</p>

<p>Thus, our intuitions can tell us that something will not be the case, that certain boundaries exist between things negatively or categorically. Now, Chomsky would then rebut that the same standard was used by the Cartesians to leverage the view that the heavenly bodies must have had extra-physical properties. I agree, but to say this is to say that an epistemic method should not be trusted if it does not produce the correct notion 100% of the time, which we know is untrue.</p>

<p>In fact, I’d argue that, at the point in the canon of physics that we are, we should have better foresight, better intuition, than ever before to know what won’t count as physical.</p>

<p><em>(Illustration to the audience)</em> You return to the farm 20 years later. Still no map or legal documents. This time, however, the farmer has added multiple fields that cluster around 3 miles from the shed. A reasonable person would now adjust their boundary estimate: the non-property area might start around 10 miles out instead of 50. Progress can be made from new information, even if the borders are not fully specified.</p>

<p>We are no longer in the same scholarship as the Cartesians precisely because of new discoveries, and therefore we are more justified in intuiting that conscious processes and mental phenomena cannot be the product of physical activity, even if we haven’t the completion of the physical canon. To reject doing so is extreme epistemic humility—more precisely, anti-Bayesian.</p>

<p>Pragmatically, unscientific but reasonable, intuitive inferences are already being produced from the wealth of new information that suggest extra-physical reality is necessary or even the only one that does objectively exist. <em>(To the live audience: I recommend reading Kaku, Heisenberg, Barr, and more on the measurement problem and consciousness.)</em> This is not conclusive, but it is suggestive.</p>

<p>Therefore, we at least have enough of a conception of the body to formulate the mind-body problem. (Formulation is different from solvability. Chomsky concludes the problem is unsolvable because there is not a clear formulation of it, but he does not address solvability in the presence of clear formulation.)</p>

<p><strong>Summarized:</strong> Chomsky proposes that because the physical is still subject to aggregation or shifts to its definition, we cannot demarcate the body, and therefore the mind-body problem remains informulable and, by extension, unsolvable. His standards potentially lead to epistemic paradoxes, and current intuition suggests the mind-body problem is still formulable even granting the lack of a complete account of the physical.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> A question I received was which premise I objected to. The objection was to the consequent. I might grant the antecedent to some degree, but the argument falters after that. Similar objections could be made to later arguments in Chomsky’s text.</p>

<p>I also recommend Edward Feser on this topic. And for the physics angle, Michael Jones’ <em>Quantum God</em> series is an accessible and useful exploration of why extra-physical hypotheses are not only conceivable but sometimes strongly suggested.</p>
